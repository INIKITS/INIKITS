## Hello! My name is Dakota
I'm looking for work as a **fullstack** or **front end developer**. I love the creativity that comes with programming and the community has been even better. Some of the projects I've worked on recently are as follows (LiveSite || Repo) :

- ### [Stranger's Things](https://soft-rugelach-d74a35.netlify.app/) (in progress) || [repo](https://github.com/INIKITS/StrangersThings)
a craigslist-lite web-app made using React with messaging, login verification, and ability to create/delete posts.

- ### [Art Collector](https://deluxe-queijadas-846d7e.netlify.app/) || repo - private (let's [chat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakota-solis-77022377/) about this!)
a web app I created using React to search through Harvard Art Museums' collections with the ability to search using different parameters


---

- ### [Arcade](https://snazzy-dieffenbachia-89d097.netlify.app/) || [repo](https://github.com/INIKITS/Arcade)
a snake game using vanilla js. I had fun with this one because I got to make music for it and figuring out the game logic was interesting.
