## Hello!
My name is Dakota and I'm looking for work as a **fullstack** or **front end developer**. I love the creativity that comes with programming and the community has been even better. Some of the projects I've worked on recently are as follows:

- ### Stranger's Things (in progress) 
a craigslist-lite webapp made using React with messaging, login verification and, ability to create/delete posts.
       repo - https://github.com/INIKITS/StrangersThings
       
       

- ### [Art Collector](https://deluxe-queijadas-846d7e.netlify.app/) -
      a web app I created using React to search through Harvard Art Museums' collections with the ability to search using different parameters
      repo - private





- ### [Arcade](https://snazzy-dieffenbachia-89d097.netlify.app/)
      a snake game using vanilla js. I had fun with this one because I got to make music for it and figuring out the game logic was interesting.
      repo - https://github.com/INIKITS/Arcade
     
     
     
     

I'm currently making my way through Fullstack Academy x OU and learning amongst others like me.

If anyone would like to collaborate on The Odin Project projects or anything else, I love talking to other people about programming and helping out when I can!
