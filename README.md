Hello! My name is Dakota and I decided over quarantine (like many others), I needed a change from working in the service industry and blue collar jobs to a career where I could grow as far as I could learn. My current goal is to get my foot in the door with a company who will allow me to show them I am worth their time. 

I'm currently making my way through The Odin Project's courses and loving the ups and downs. I've learned not to be so hard on myself and just work through the hiccups.

If anyone would like to collaborate on TOP projects or anything else, I'd love to start talking to other people about programming.

If you'd like to reach me, my email is dakota.h.solis@gmail.com
